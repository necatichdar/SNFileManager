# SNFileManager
Java Swing ile Dosya YÃ¶neticisi
SNFileManager is a basic Java Swing file manager. We used Java JDK 8 for JTree, JTable, JPanel, JToolBar, JButton and JLabel. Also Jaco MP3 Player for MP3 player and Jave for MP3 durations. You can download to Jaco MP3 from http://jacomp3player.sourceforge.net/ and Jave from http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/jave/ Please add to Jaco and Jave's JAR file to Netbeans project, because the project is uses these libraries.
